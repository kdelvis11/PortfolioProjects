This repository will hold all of the various projects for KD Dial's public portfolio along with all related code, queries, and data files associated with those projects.


SQL Exploration Project - Exploring Global COVID-19 Trends
- The objective of this SQL project was to extract meaningful insights from a comprehensive COVID-19 dataset sourced from Our World in Data (ourworldindata.org). The overarching business task was to identify actionable trends related to cases, deaths, and vaccinations on a global scale.
- Constructed various queries to analyze and compare the COVID-19 case rates, death rates, and vaccination rates across continents, countries, and dates. Translated raw data into actionable knowledge that could inform policymakers, healthcare professionals, and researchers in developing targeted strategies for managing the pandemic.
- Tools and technologies used: Microsoft Excel, MySQL, MySQL Workbench, and Our World in Data COVID-19 Dataset.

SQL Cleaning Project - Cleansing Nashville Housing Data for Analysis
- This SQL project was aimed to cleanse and prepare a Nashville housing dataset for in-depth analysis. The focus was on transforming raw data into a refined, standardized format, optimizing it for meaningful insights and informed decision-making.
- Identified and eliminated duplicate values, standardized and normalized date formats, populated NULL values using existing data wherever possible, split full address fields into distinct columns, and replaced ambiguous values with more explicit terms for clarity.
- Tools and technologies used: MS SQL Server, Azure Data Studio, and Nashville Housing Dataset.
